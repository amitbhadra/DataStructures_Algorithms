/*
**  Given a positive integer, output its complement number. 
**  The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.
**
**  Note:
**  The given integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
**  You could assume no leading zero bit in the integerâ€™s binary representation.
**  Example 1:
**  Input: 5
**  Output: 2
**  Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.
**  Example 2:
**  Input: 1
**  Output: 0
**  Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.
